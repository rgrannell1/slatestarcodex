This file is _mainly_ included to force Git to create the data folder on clone (lazy!). The subfiles in this folder are:

- content.sqlite: a database containing information scraped from SlateStarCodex
- site.html: a (large!) webpage including all posts from SlateStarCodex.
- site.pdf: a pdf including all posts from SlateStarCodex.
